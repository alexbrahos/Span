To run the program, run the command "make run" or execute runMe. The program will prompt the user for a seed for random number generation, and N for how many data points to use.

This program generates a list of random numbers between 0 and 99. The program will print the randomly generated numbers. Then, the program will calculate the span of each number using 2 methods. The first method is a brute force approach using nested loops. The second method uses a stack to backtrack through previous values.

The span of a number maximum number of consecutive instances (starting from that number going backwards) for which that was the greatest number. This problem is most commonly used in the stock market.
